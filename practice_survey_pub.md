# Sample Datasets â€“ can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_dQke2Fh1H-yb-EOexTFFFCRWp0FyTJ5uv3Ffer3rE/edit)

This collection of datasets lets you experiment with different types of data.

There are three types of surveys:

1. Surveys without associated images (such as the EarthCube Member  Survey): for such surveys you can specify icons based on values of one  or two variables when modifying survey settings in SuAVE.
2. Surveys or collections with a limited set of icons/logos: typically, they are easy to publish using our tile generator (examples: the  Observing Systems Explorer; the 2018 SDG Indicators dataset).
3. Image collections with real high-resolution images: the images may  differ in size, and sometimes take hours to create tile collections from (examples: the San Diego Vacant Lots survey, Picasso Paintings, the  USGS Earth As Art collection, soil samples in wetlands of the Lower  Mekong.)

Further, these sample datasets demonstrate spatial data of different geometric types.

In the collection of sample surveys, each survey has a README file,  and all components (csv files, images, dzc collections) ready for  publishing in SuAVE.

You can also see how the sample surveys appear in SuAVE at http://suave-dev.sdsc.edu/gallery/spatialsuave.

1. **Click the Jupyter button to launch Jupyter notebooks for your survey.** Select CHASE-CI as the Jupyter hub to use, authenticate with a Google  account, and wait for the system to spawn a server. Click through cells  in the “dispatcher” notebook to select a notebook you want to launch.  Explore the notebooks – and note that not all notebooks will be  available for all surveys (e.g. if your survey doesn’t use images then  notebooks related to image processing won’t be shown).
